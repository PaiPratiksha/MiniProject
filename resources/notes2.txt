-subbands like delta, theta, alpha , beta, gamma etc
-parameters are => std deviation, correlation, largest lyapunov exponent
-classificatiopn techniques => unsupervised k means clustering, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, radial basis function NN, Levenberg - Marquardt backpropagation NN
-Two types of analysis => band- specific and mixed band analysis
-accuracy of 96.7%
-ictal activity means seizure
-the stages include => preictal/ interical state and then the ictal state
-in interictal state => neurons start firing in multiple parts of brain in synchronisation with of each other with epileptogenic focus leading to ictal state

two approaches for seizure detection from eeg analysis 
-examination of eeg events in interical eeg to find spikes that are precursors to seizures
-analysis of spatio-temporal evolution of eeg signals to find a governing rule

three groups of eeg dataset:
-normal eeg
-interictal eeg
-ictal eeg
thus it is modelled as 3 group classification problem 

the paper postulates that eeg represents the effect of superimposition of various processes of the brain

Feature Space design:
-wavelet-chaos methodology
-after wavelet transform, find the CD (correlation dimension), LLE (Largest Lyapunov exponent), SD(standard deviation)









































SVMs broaden the concept of hyperplane separration to the data that cannot be separated linearly, by mapping the predictors onto a new, higher dimensional space in which they can be separated linearly
-disadvantage is not of the order of number of samples but order of number of samples

SVMs and PNNs are used as classifiers

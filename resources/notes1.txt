t-f Analysis of EEG signals for epileptic seizure
- time frequency analysis

-two major problems are-- 
1. interictal event distribution
2.epileptic seizure anaysis

algos used for spike detection/interical event D
-wavelet transform
-ANN
-independent PCA
-SVMs
-data mining
-template matching
-topological classification

algos for 2
-epileptic seizure detection
-ES prediction
-automatic focus channel identification

METHODS
1.Time-frequency analysis
-STFT and TFD- suffers tradeoff between window length and frequency resolution
-the TFDs used here are Cohen's class of distribution
-in cohen's distribution the representation is quadratic
-there is a kernel?


-frequency subbands in eeg tf analysis are 0-2.5, 2.5 -5.5, 5.5-10.5, 10.5-21.5, 21.5-43.5
-time domain is divided into 3 segments and the frequency into 5. energy of each segment and total energy are the features extracted (3*5+1). the features so extracted are reduced to 3-4 vectors using PCA;


Use of ANNs
-N inputs
-5XN hidden layers
-K outputs b/w [0,1]
-sigmoid units with hyperbolic tangent function
-other classification schemes are Naive Bayes, decision trees, k-nearest neighbour,logistic regression

Naive bayes = class conditional independence
k-NN = closeness to neighbours 
learn about decision trees
decision trees = ask chandu- original set is divided into finer subsets
logistic regression


Results:
-the dataset is divided into 5 subsets includes Z O N F S;
- each subsegment has 100 single channel eeg segments of 23.6 s each
-Z => eyes open, healthy volunteer
-O => eyes closed, healthy volunteer
-N => hippocampal zone of a patient during the non seizure time
-F => epileptic zone of a patient during non sseizure
-S => contains seizure activity, from all the recording sites exhibiting ictal activity

3 types of positioning of the electrode
a => extracranial 
b => intracranial - depth - implanted symmtrically into the hippocampal formation
c => intracranial - strip - implanted into the lateral and basal regions of neocortex (part of cerebral cortex)

Z, O => a
N, F => b
S => b, c

-data is 12 bit resolution and 173.61 samples/sec

3 steps of classification
- normal and affected
- normal, seizure free, seizure
-normal open, normal closed, seizure in other regions and in the epileptic zone during seizure free time, activity during seizure

- STFT and 12 other TFDs were used giving 39 test cases

sensitivity(i)  = # patterns of class i classified in class i/total # of patterns in class i

selectivity(i) = # patterns of class i identified in class i/total # patterns classified in class i

accuracy = # of correctly classified patterns / total # of patterns

check the percentage accuracy of each of the methods

Discussion:
percent accuracy 
use of smoothing windows
high frequency components above 43.5 hz were not measured


i dont get this

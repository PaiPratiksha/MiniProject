wavelets for images :
cV = vertical differencing - horizontal lines
cH = horizontal diff - vertical lines
cD = diagonal diff		



-Z => eyes open, healthy volunteer
-O => eyes closed, healthy volunteer
-N => hippocampal zone of a patient during the non seizure time
-F => epileptic zone of a patient during non sseizure
-S => contains seizure activity, from all the recording sites exhibiting ictal activity
